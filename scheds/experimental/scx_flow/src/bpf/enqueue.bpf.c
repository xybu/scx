 * Enqueue op.
 *
 * Every wakeup earns one EDF deadline from the burst predictor else
 * the hint period plus one virtual deadline from vruntime plus slice
 * over weight, and every task joins a tier queue with no admission
 * bound. Queue order uses the earlier of the two times, so urgent
 * tasks still win while hogs fall behind with lag bounds. Tasks join
 * direct when the target can drain before the shared home, so no task
 * waits for a busy CPU while shared room stays open. Missed tasks
 * rejoin a tier queue with a fresh deadline plus a miss count and one
 * idle kick and no wait. Pinned tasks wait in a tier queue with wait
 * set and one idle kick. Exiting tasks run at once on the task CPU
 * with no queue wait and no gate. The gate runs first for all other
 * arrivals, so a stale CPU plus a moved task fails closed with one
 * counter. The predictor average plus deviation shape later deadlines
 * with shift updates from stopping, so short bursts earn tight
 * deadlines with no table walk. Vruntime advances by scaled service
 * with one divide, and the CPU minimum folds forward on every charge,
 * so fairness tracks service with no table. Every tier join counts one
 * admit with no reject, so the counters track joins with no bound. The
 * exiting plus idle direct plus helper plus direct block form the four
 * kick points, so every wait meets at most one kick with no storm. A
 * direct preempt needs an eligible arrival plus a 100us margin lead
 * with more than 100us still left on the owner, so near ties plus
 * nearly done owners never bounce while one kick per wait stays.
 * Slice expiry paces the rest, so no slice write and no stamp run
 * here. Local plus node depths hoist once, so the drain gated bypass
 * plus the combined drain tier escalation share one read with no second
 * poll. See intf.h for the deadline plus fairness helpers and
 * dispatch.bpf.c for the tier scans.
 *
 * The op holds the target plus insert plus kick helpers in enqueue/
 * with the fair plus clamp plus pinned plus place plus kick noinline
 * on scalar input, so the verifier stays small.

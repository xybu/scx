//! Mirrors BPF dispatch.bpf.c with the fixed five-tier order plus the
//! shared visit cap plus the saturated steal early-out plus the Q1
//! only fast path plus hint threaded moves plus fused perf. Tier order
//! is local plus node plus machine plus overflow plus steal with at most
//! one hint move per tier bounded by remaining slots. Five depths hoist
//! once, so tiers plus steal plus perf share the same reads with no
//! second poll. Visits cap at eight per pass shared across tiers with
//! resume next pass. Steal scans four to eight peers with saturation
//! proportional to remaining visits and only when all four queued tiers
//! hold no backlog with per peer hints threaded into the shared hint
//! move. Perf reuses the hoisted local plus local on plus node hints with
//! no kfunc in per CPU scope only with no machine plus overflow plus
//! steal, so shared backlog never forces max on an idle CPU. BPF gates
//! the probe on live while this mirror is test-only with no live check.
//! The shared cursor with select advances by two on success with best
//! effort races, and the TOCTOU between hoisted hints and moves only
//! repeats or skips a pass with no loss. Test-only with no map use.

//! Clippy stays clean on stable 1.91 with `-Dwarnings`.
